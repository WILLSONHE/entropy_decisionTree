# entropy_decisionTree

Our end goal relates to be able to predict which Class2 or 4 (2=benign, 4=malignant ) is more likely to come from from which data.  We will start the process of building a decision tree but  first, we need to calculate the proportions.

This VBA function allows for a compact way of computing the Entropy for a particular value in a range. Add this function to Module1.  What would be the Excel formula that could calculate value of countIn (after the loop)?
